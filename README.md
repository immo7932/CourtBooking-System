# Court Booking for the Game

## Project Description

Court Booking for the Game is a web application where users can book sports courts for different games. Each court can be reserved for one-hour slots, and users are prevented from booking a court that is already occupied during the chosen time. The platform provides a seamless experience for managing and viewing available courts.
