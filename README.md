---

### Prerequisites  
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org).
- A running instance of the **backend API**. Update the API endpoints in the code if necessary.
- **Git** installed for version control (optional but recommended).

---

### Installation  

#### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/court-booking-system.git
```

#### Navigate to the Project Directory:
```bash
cd court-booking-system
```

#### Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

---

### Running the Application  

#### Development Mode  
To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend application will start on `http://localhost:3000` by default, and the backend API will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Production Build  
To create a production build for the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized static files in the `build` directory.

### Deployment  

#### Frontend Deployment  
1. **Connect Repository**: Log in to [Render.com](https://render.com) and connect your GitHub repository.
2. **Create a New Static Site**:
   - Select the `frontend` directory.
   - Set the build command to `npm run build`.
   - Set the publish directory to `build`.
3. **Environment Variables**: If required, set environment variables in Render.com's dashboard.
4. **Deploy**: Render.com will automatically build and deploy your frontend application.

#### Backend Deployment  
1. **Connect Repository**: Log in to [Render.com](https://render.com) and connect your GitHub repository.
2. **Create a New Web Service**:
   - Select the `backend` directory.
   - Set the build command to `npm install`.
   - Set the start command to `npm start`.
3. **Environment Variables**: Add necessary environment variables such as:
   - `PORT=5000`
   - `MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string`
   - `JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret`
4. **Deploy**: Render.com will automatically install dependencies and start your backend server.

### Assumptions and Limitations  
- **Authentication**: The application assumes that user authentication is handled via JWT tokens stored securely in localStorage.
- **API Endpoints**: The frontend expects specific API endpoints (e.g., `/api/user/login`, `/api/centre/getCentre`). Ensure these endpoints are available and correctly configured.
- **Booking Limitation**: Users cannot book court slots unless authenticated. Proper authentication flow must be maintained.
- **Date Range**: The application displays available slots for the next 7 days.
- **Data Structure**: The code assumes certain structures for the data returned from the API. Modify the code if your API responses differ.

---

### Special Instructions  
- **Environment Variables**: For security, set environment variables directly in the deployment environment (Render.com dashboard) instead of using `.env` files in production.
- **Styling Conflicts**: The application uses Chakra UI for styling. Avoid mixing external CSS and Chakra UI styles to prevent conflicts.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented. Further enhancements might be necessary for production, such as more descriptive error messages and logging.

---

### Dependencies  

#### Frontend:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: For handling routing in the application.

#### Backend:
- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: For database management.
- **bcryptjs**

: For hashing passwords (replacing bcrypt to avoid native module issues).
- **jsonwebtoken**: For handling JWT tokens.
- **dotenv**: For loading environment variables.
- **cors**: For enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **body-parser**: For parsing incoming request bodies.

#### Other Tools:
- **Nodemon**: For automatically restarting the server during development.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from the frontend.

For a complete list of dependencies and their versions, refer to the respective `package.json` files in the frontend and backend directories.
